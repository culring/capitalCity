# capitalCity

Cities are connected with each other with optical fibres. Lines are maintained by cities and each city can afford to maintain only 2 optical fibres (connections with two different cities). It is allowed that two cities can be connected with two separate optical fibres (each city maintain exactly one connection from a pair). Applied technology enforces restriction that each city can own up to 1 connection that is not maintained by itself (thus maximum number of connections for each city equals 3 - two maintained by itself and another one by other city). Due to a crisis, every single month one city looses its connection. For each city give a number of months after which it looses its connection with a capital. It is given a structure of connections between cities, a sequence of consecutively removed optical fibres and a capital.
